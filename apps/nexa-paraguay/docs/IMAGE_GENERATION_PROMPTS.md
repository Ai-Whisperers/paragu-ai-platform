# 🔴 P0 — Launch-blocking (20 images)

## Brand identity (items 1–6)

> For items 1–6 use a **vector-first tool** (logo generator, Figma, Illustrator). AI raster generators are poor for crisp logos. Prompts here produce *concept references* you can vectorize.

### 1. `brand/logo.svg` — Primary logo (horizontal)
Aspect: 5:2

```
Minimalist wordmark logo concept "Nexa Paraguay", two words stacked or horizontal,
serif capital "N" in Playfair Display paired with modern sans body, deep navy #1B2A4A
on pure white background, optional thin champagne #C9A96E accent (a single stroke or dot),
institutional finance-firm aesthetic, flat vector style, crisp edges, generous negative space,
centered, professional, timeless, high contrast. No photographic elements, no gradients,
no 3D effects. Logomark only, no tagline.
```
**Deliverable:** vectorize the chosen concept; export SVG + 2048px transparent PNG.

### 2. `brand/logo-dark.svg` — Monochrome white
Aspect: 5:2

Same prompt as #1, swap the navy for pure white `#FFFFFF`, background transparent. Used on hero overlay and dark CTA banners.

### 3. `brand/logo-icon.svg` — Icon-only mark
Aspect: 1:1

```
Minimalist monogram icon for "Nexa Paraguay", a single glyph combining the letter N with
a subtle compass-point or arch reference (a bridge, a doorway) that hints at relocation
without being literal, navy #1B2A4A on white, flat vector, geometric, symmetrical,
fits inside a 512×512 circle safe area, works as a 16×16 favicon, timeless wordless mark.
```

### 4. `brand/favicon.ico` — Favicon
Multi-res 16/32/48 from #3.

### 5. `brand/apple-touch-icon.png` — iOS home-screen icon
180×180 PNG from #3, navy background rounded square.

### 6. `brand/maskable-512.png` — PWA maskable

(Torres del Paseo, Torre Pacífico silhouettes) rising over the Paraguay River,
warm amber and deep navy-blue sky gradient, a few lit windows beginning to glow,
pristine cloudless evening, no visible people or cars in foreground,
negative space on the upper left for headline text, professional travel-editorial quality,
reminiscent of Monocle magazine, Conde Nast Traveler. The mood is institutional,
prosperous, calm, inviting — not touristy, not flashy.
```
Append **Style block** + **Universal negative**.

### 8. `hero/hero-bg-mobile.jpg` — Home hero (mobile)
Aspect: 9:16 · 828×1100

# Quick-start execution order

If budget allows only one batch:

1. **Day 1 (1 hour):** Generate items **17–20** (OG cards + placeholder). Eliminates embarrassment.
2. **Day 1 (2 hours):** Generate items **7–16** (hero + pillars + process). Site looks intentional.
3. **Day 2 (1 hour):** Generate items **36–45** (blog covers). `/blog` page stops 404-ing.
4. **Day 2 (2 hours):** Generate items **21–31** (team + office) as **staging-only placeholders**.
5. **Week 1:** Real photo shoot to replace items **21–31** and **46–55**.
6. **Month 1+:** Generate P3 paid-ads library on demand per campaign.

# 🟣 P4 — Coverage gaps identified in audit (Apr 2026)

After wiring the first 111 assets we found six gaps that materially
affect how serious the site looks to an expat shopping this type of
service: a founder portrait, document reassurance, branded icons, maps,
partner trust, a standalone comparison infographic. Every P4 prompt
still appends **Style block** + **Universal negative**.

## P4.1 — Founder / CEO portrait 👤

Aspect: 4:5 · Desired output: `team/founder.png`

```
Editorial portrait of a Latin American business executive in their 40s,
navy suit with an open-collar white shirt, no tie, seated at a walnut
desk in an Asunción office, neutral warm-grey wall behind with a single
framed map print and a brass desk lamp catching champagne-colored
light, direct but approachable eye contact with the camera, confident
relaxed posture, hands resting on desk, late-afternoon window light
from the left, shallow depth of field background softly defocused,
the feel of an FT Weekend profile shoot. Not a headshot on a grey
backdrop — a portrait with environmental context.
```
**Wiring:** add `team.founder` to `images.json`; render on `/sobre`
above the team grid with a short founder bio. Also expose as
`press.founder` on `/prensa` for media requests.

## P4.2 — Document mockups (reassurance)

Illustrated, NOT photorealistic reproductions — these must never be
mistaken for real Paraguayan ID documents (fraud risk).

### 21. `trust/cedula-mockup.png` — aspect 3:2
```
Flat 3/4-top-down composition of a single generic "ID card"
illustration on a walnut desk, clearly stylized (soft drop shadow,
slightly exaggerated proportions, no photographic textures, no real
coat of arms, placeholder text "00.000.000", generic silhouette
photo placeholder). Palette: navy and champagne. Caption space clear
bottom right. Purpose: reassure prospects that they receive a national
ID at the end of the process without impersonating the real cédula.
```

### 22. `trust/ruc-certificate-mockup.png` — aspect 3:2
```
Illustration of a corporate registration certificate on a leather
blotter, obviously fictional letterhead (placeholder crest, Lorem
Ipsum paragraph), gold wax seal bottom right, Mont Blanc pen laid
across the page, brass table lamp catching champagne light. Editorial
illustration style, NOT a reproduction of any real RUC certificate.
```

### 23. `trust/residency-card-mockup.png` — aspect 3:2
```
Two-up composition of a stylized residency card + a passport (closed,
spine up, muted colour not tied to any real country) on a linen cloth,
warm window light from right, small glass of tereré beside them for
cultural anchoring. Illustrated feel with clean gradient shading, NOT
a photograph — obvious at 10 paces this is a product visualisation.
```

**Wiring:** `trust.cedulaMockup` / `trust.rucCertificateMockup` /
`trust.residencyCardMockup`. Use on `/programas` tier cards ("what you
receive") + relevant blog post thumbnails.

## P4.3 — Service icon set (12 icons)

Replaces Lucide glyphs on `/por-que-paraguay`, `/programas`, `/proceso`.
Aspect 1:1. Output: `icons/service-<name>.svg` (vectorize after raster
generation).

Generic prompt — swap the **Subject** line per icon:

```
Minimalist editorial line-icon, single continuous-stroke feel, 2px
equivalent weight, navy #1B2A4A on transparent/white background,
subtle champagne #C9A96E accent on ONE element only (a dot or arc),
inside a 512×512 square with 48px padding, NO text, NO drop shadows,
NO gradients, NO photographic elements. Inspired by Monocle, Financial
Times, and the Noun Project paid tier. Reads clearly at 32×32 and 16×16.

Subject: <NAME>
```

Icons:
1. `service-residency` — hand holding ID card
2. `service-company` — building silhouette with pillar entrance
3. `service-bank-account` — bank card with subtle lock
4. `service-tax-id` — document with barcode
5. `service-property` — house with key
6. `service-apostille` — stamped paper + ribbon
7. `service-notary` — quill on scroll
8. `service-visa` — passport with stamp arc
9. `service-banking` — columns with vault hint
10. `service-education` — graduation cap
11. `service-healthcare` — medical cross inside soft shield
12. `service-consultation` — two speech bubbles overlapping

**Deliverable:** generate concept PNGs, vectorize to SVG, add `icons` bucket
to `images.json`. Wire via optional `iconSrc` prop that overrides the
Lucide name when provided.

## P4.4 — Map graphics

### 24. `maps/paraguay-coverage.png` — aspect 3:2
```
Editorial-style vector map of Paraguay, stylized (not geographically
precise), deep navy landmass on warm off-white background, champagne
highlight pins on: Asunción (larger), Ciudad del Este, San Bernardino,
Encarnación. Thin neighbouring-country outlines (Argentina, Brasil,
Bolivia). No labels, no compass rose. Feels like a map insert in a
Monocle country guide.
```

### 25. `maps/asuncion-neighborhoods.png` — aspect 3:2
```
Editorial stylized map of central Asunción, navy street-grid on warm
off-white, champagne-filled highlight blocks for Villa Morra, Las
Carmelitas, Mburucuyá, Costanera. Paraguay River as a gentle champagne
wash at top-left. Small illustrated pin markers for Shopping del Sol,
Parque Ñu Guasu, Costanera Park. Thin north arrow, no compass rose.
Premium relocation-guide aesthetic.
```

**Wiring:** `maps.paraguayCoverage` on `/por-que-paraguay`;
`maps.asuncionNeighborhoods` as a secondary hero on the `neighborhoods`
blog post.

## P4.5 — Partner / press-mention placeholder slots

No new imagery needed — wire `trust-signals` section with its `logos-row`
variant rendering partner logos. Until real partnerships are named,
populate with "Próximamente" / "Coming soon" text slots so the layout
reserves space.

- `/sobre` — second trust-signals block "Socios bancarios y legales"
  with 5 slots.
- home — below existing credentials block: "Menciones en medios",
  4 slots.

When real partnerships ship, swap the placeholder labels for actual
logos (obtain from the partner's brand guidelines, don't scrape).

## P4.6 — Standalone comparison infographic

---

# Bucket addition rules

When adding any P4/P5 asset to the manifest:

1. Generate the image.
2. Convert to WebP via `npm run convert:tenant-images -- nexa-paraguay`.
3. Add entry to `sites/nexa-paraguay/images.json` under the correct
   bucket (create new buckets `icons/`, `maps/`, `infographics/`,
   `misc/` if needed).
4. Include `altByLocale` for all 4 locales at creation time (don't
   defer — backfilling across a dozen assets is painful).
5. Run `npm run validate:tenant-images -- nexa-paraguay` — must pass.
6. Update MEMORY.md or the admin dashboard label if the asset replaces
   an AI placeholder (so the launch-gate hashes stay in sync).

_Last updated: April 2026. Keep this file in sync with `images.json` and `sites/nexa-paraguay/images/` directory structure._
