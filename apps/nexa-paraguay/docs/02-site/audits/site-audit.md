> **⚠️ NOTE:** This audit pre-dates Sonia's May 8 feedback and May 11 meeting.
> The "orphan pages" section (items 26-41) recommends linking pages that Sonia explicitly **rejected** (wizard, team, stats, comparisons).
> See `docs/CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/meetings/meeting-report-may-11.md` for current status.

### Count of `"ctaHref": "#"` placeholders

## 18. CONVERSION FLOW

### User Journey
1. User lands on homepage → sees hero + services + packages + process
2. CTA: "Book free consultation" → goes to `/contacto` page
3. Contact page has: Calendly embed link + WhatsApp fallback + email
4. Secondary flow: Intake wizard at `/asistente` (not nav-linked)
5. WhatsApp float button on every page

**Missing:** Post-submission confirmation page, email nurture sequence (asset headers exist but no content), analytics tracking on CTAs.

## PRIORITY RANKING

2. **HubSpot portal ID** — replace `HS-PORTAL-PARAGUAI` with real portal + form ID
3. **Mailchimp audience ID** — replace placeholder
4. **Landing page CTAs** — 2 per locale still point to `#`

6. **German locale** — flagged as machine-translated, needs professional review
7. **nl.json/de.json missing top-level `seo` key**
8. **Stats numbers** (+500 families, +10 years, 98%) — not confirmed by client

10. **Placeholder CTAs** — 2 per locale in landing pages still `#`
11. **Facebook link** — null, add if client has one
