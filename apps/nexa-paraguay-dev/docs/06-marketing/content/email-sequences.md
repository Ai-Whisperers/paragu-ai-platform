that cover 90% of use cases. All content is multi-locale (EN/ES/NL/DE).

## Sequence A: Tax-Driven Interest

| 2  | 3   | "What you could save — real numbers" | Tax comparison table (100K income) |
| 3  | 7   | "8-12 weeks. One trip. Here's how." | Process walkthrough |
| 4  | 10  | "What clients say after 12 months" | Social proof, testimonials |
