## SECTION 1: MARKET POSITIONING

### Target Market Size

|---------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Dutch ZZPers considering exit | 5K-10K actively looking | 1-2/mo |
| German pensioners 55+ abroad | 2K-5K considering PY | 0.5-1/mo |
| Belgian digital nomads | 1K-3K | 0.5/mo |
| UK tax optimizers (post-non-dom) | 500-2K | 0.5/mo |
| **Total addressable** | **11K-25K/yr** | **2-5 clients/mo** |

### Competitor Pricing

| Competitor | Price (USD) | Weakness | Sonia's Advantage |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| DIY | $750-$1,000 | 6-10 office visits, Spanish required, high rejection | One coordinated trip, no language barrier |
| MoveToParaguay | $1,200-$2,300 | Generic, no local relationships | Personal relationships with banks/notaries |
| Low Cost Paraguay | $350 | Unverified quality, zero support | Full hand-holding |
| WeParaguay | $1,400-$6,500 | Pricing page 404, EN/ES only | Dutch native, personal brand |
| Paraguay Sovereign | $2,290-$5,490 | Same issues | Acompañamiento casi familiar |
| **Nexa (her audio)** | **$1,500 ← AMBIGUITY** | Undefined pricing | **This is the #1 fix** |
| **Nexa (our model)** | **$2,900-$6,900** | May be too high? | Needs Sonia validation |

## SECTION 6: KEY DECISIONS NEEDED FROM SONIA

### P0 — Must Answer Today (Site Blockers)
| # | Question | Why It Matters |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | **Price: $1,500 or $2,900?** | All site pricing depends on this. Her audio said $1,500. Our model says $2,900. |
| 2 | **Her full story: include nervous breakdown?** | Defines brand power. "Acompañamiento casi familiar" is hollow without the real story. |
| 3 | **Photos: when can I come take them?** | Site credibility blocker. Current images are AI placeholders. |
| 4 | **WhatsApp QR: scan now (1 minute)** | Unlocks lead gen. Bot is configured but dead without QR scan. |

### P1 — Site Structure
| # | Question | Options |
|---|----------|---------|
| 5 | One service + add-ons, or packages? | Determines pricing page design |
| 6 | Ideal client profile? | Families? Dutch only? Not USA? Defines all content |
| 7 | First-person or third-person voice? | "Sonia habla como Sonia" vs "Nexa Paraguay ofrece" |
| 8 | Blog: AI content or her writing? | SEO potential vs authenticity |

### P2 — Monetization
| # | Question | Suggested Answer |
|---|----------|-----------------|
| 9 | Post-residency day rate? | $150-250/day (she doesn't know what to charge) |
| 10 | School research fee? | $200 one-time (families are her target) |
| 11 | Commission income numbers? | Property 2.75%, vehicle/legal/appliance unknown |

### P3 — Operations
| # | Question | Notes |
|---|----------|-------|
| 12 | Office address? | Home, La Vieja Holanda, or virtual "Asunción" |
| 13 | SEPRELAD status? | Ask her lawyer if registration is needed |
| 14 | nexaparaguay.com domain? | Move DNS to 72.61.44.159 |
| 15 | Investor meeting audio? | Record it → goldmine of market intelligence |
| 16 | Capacity? | Can she handle 3-4 clients/month? |
| 17 | AI adoption? | WhatsApp bot for 24/7 lead qualification |

## SECTION 7: DATA QUALITY & COVERAGE

### Strengths
- **1,485 places mapped in Asunción** — all with GPS coordinates
- **36 categories covered** — from banks to bakeries, gyms to dentists
- **1,349 with phone numbers** — client-ready referral data
- **765 with websites** — for digital presence verification
- **All GeoJSON/CSV exports** ready for GIS analysis
- **17 department analysis** complete with city profiles

### Gaps
- Niche categories (embassies, fire stations, bus stations) not well-tagged in Google Maps API
- Professional services (lawyers, accountants, real estate agents) — Sonia's personal network is better than API data
- Some categories like "car rental" and "parking" are low-density in Asunción
- The scraper was interrupted before completing all 65 search types (got 30 basic + 12 quick + merged beauty = ~42 categories)

### To Fill Remaining Gaps
- Run `scripts/scrape_all_types.py --dept Central --types all` with a fresh API key (Google Cloud $200 free credit)
- The checkpoint at `data/py_all_types_checkpoint.json` has 1,485 businesses saved and will auto-resume
- 20 remaining types are mostly niche (embassy, fire station, airport, etc.) — manual entry for these is faster than API scraping
